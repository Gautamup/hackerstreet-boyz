IsFresher : True

Idea : 	To bridge the communication gap between senior and junior of the same Institute.

Problem:  As the Fresher, It is laborious to find and approach the right senior:

In UniTie, we are providing student section  where  we can meet whole of our institute students at one place. From there, a student can make a request to seniors and can have chat. And a section for clubs of the Institute. 
Unitie is providing students an easy way to firstly find the right senior that will guide them and secondly a chat facility for conversation. 
This will surely benefit lot of students searching for right mentorship. 
Our agenda is to make intra-college communication easy, efficient and productive and hence the name: “UniTie” where Uni stands for University . 

In future , various other facilities would be added to the website . Such as: 

1.	Our website will also provide info about various events occurring in the college so that students don’t miss out on any under news section.	
2.	A functional search bar where a student can search names , branches , events , #tags and filter out students as per choice.
3.	 Virtual rooms can be created for any team related activities.
